Just some days ago, several people asked me about my blog website. I do think this website is kind of awesome and I think if I make it reusable, it might benefits others a lot. Therefore, I made it a blog template. It didn't take me a long time to do so. If you like this template, please give it a star on [Github](https://github.com/zihan-ch/zihan-blog).

# Features

This website is super fast. The cursor is the favourite thing in this website in my opinion. Also, both dark mode and light mode are supported and it's fully responsive. I might be updating the theme if there are some bad designs here.
